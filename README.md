This example demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Dockerfiles:  using a generic base image and unclear application purpose.  The original Dockerfile uses `alpine:latest`, which can change unexpectedly in the future, potentially breaking your build. Additionally, the application itself is not well defined. The solution provides best practices to address both these vulnerabilities.
